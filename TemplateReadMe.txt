The goal was to create a skeletal application with the following UI components placed in the intended layout:

############# Main Window #############
Left Dock: File Explorer placeholder (QTreeView or QListWidget as a stand-in)
Center Area: A QTabWidget to host open file editor tabs
Right Dock: Outline/Symbol view placeholder (a simple QListWidget for now)
Bottom Dock: Terminal placeholder (a QPlainTextEdit simulating a terminal)

############# Features in Prototype: #############
A main window with three dockable areas and one central widget.
Basic UI elements:
Left: A mock “File Explorer” panel.
Center: A QTabWidget representing open files (one dummy tab for demonstration).
Right: A mock “Outline” panel (just shows placeholder text).
Bottom: A mock terminal window that the user can type into.
Top: A mock for a quick/settings bar.


############# Non-Functional Mock Behavior: #############
No actual file system navigation or symbol parsing at this stage.
No actual terminal functionality.
Focused on showing the basic layout and docking functionality.



############# Next Steps for Further Development #############

############# File Explorer Integration: #############

Replace the dummy list widget with a QTreeView and a QFileSystemModel to display and navigate the file system.
Add double-click actions to open files in the central tab widget.

############# Editing and Saving Files: #############
Implement functionality to load file contents into QPlainTextEdit widgets in tabs.
Add actions (e.g., via menubar) to save the current file.

############# Outline Panel Logic: #############
Parse the currently active file to identify symbols (classes, functions) and display them in the outline.
Connect clicking on an outline entry to navigating the editor’s cursor.

############# Terminal Integration: #############
Use subprocess or pty (on Unix) to run commands and update the terminal widget output.
Make the terminal interactive.

############# Menu Items: #############
Each menu has placeholder actions (like "Open", "Save", "Cut", "Copy", "Paste", "Preferences")
which you can later connect to slots (functions) for actual functionality.
